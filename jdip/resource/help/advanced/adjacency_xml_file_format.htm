 <h1>Adjacency XML File Format</h1>
 <h2>Introduction</h2>
 <p>
 The Adjacency (or Province) XML file format defines the provinces (long names,
 abbreviations, and alternate names) as well as their "connectedness" (which 
 provinces connect to other provinces).
 </p>
 <p>
 The adjacency file may be shared between different variants when the variant 
 differs in starting unit positions, supply center positions, or powers. However, 
 a new adjacency file must be created for maps with different connectedness.
 </p>
 <h2>Defining Adjacenct Provinces</h2>
 <p>
 The &lt;ADJACENCY&gt; element defines adjacency for a given province. A province
 may have multiple 'layers' of adjacency; in other words, land adjacency and fleet (sea) 
 adjacency may be different. The adjacency also defines what type a province is.
 Valid province may have:
 </p>
 <ul>
 	<li><p>mv: an inland province</p></li>
 	<li><p>xc: a sea province</p></li>
 	<li><p>mv and xc: a coastal province or an island</p></li>
 	<li><p>mv and (1 or more) coasts (nc, sc, wc, or ec): a multi-coastal province or island</p></li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 It is illegal to specify an "xc" with a coast ("nc", "sc", "wc", or "ec"). This is because "xc" is
 the "any" or "single" coast.
 </p>
 <p>
 If a province is an island (adjacent to multiple sea provinces with "xc" or coastal adjacency), an
 "mv" adjacency is still required. Since an island is not (and cannot, by definition) be adjacent
 to other land provinces, the "mv" definition is just a link to itself.
 </p>
 <h2>Borders</h2>
 <p>
 Borders can exist between Provinces, which can disallow certain types of 
 orders depending upon the Border options. For example, and "ice" Border could
 disallow orders for units in the Fall seasons.
 </p>
 <p>
 <b>Note: the Border entity and attributes specifications is not yet final,
 and is subject to change.</b>
